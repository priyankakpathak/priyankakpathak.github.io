I love minimalist décor in any room. Sometimes, I believe less is more and so I do not advocate an overcrowded look. With less décor, it is always easier to maintain everything. Keeping this principle in mind, I was pleased to decorate my dining room. 

Welcome to my dining room. It is a big and bright room that can be seen from other rooms on the main floor. Today, I will start with all the key elements that I brought into this room to make it feel upscale, where we love to have dinner with our family and friends.

## Walls

When I started designing this room, I toyed paintings for the walls and landed on the two rose paintings. I am glad I painted them because they fit perfectly in our dining room. Since this room is directly off the living room and can be seen from the front door as well as the family room and kitchen, it needed to have something that was interesting on the walls. If you have seen my [last blog about the living room](../2020-08-20-Living-Room), I have painting and panels on the walls. I wanted to bring that simplicity into the dining room.

## Mixing wood tones

There are lot of different wood tones in this room and yet, it all seems to work well together. My dining table from India, has a dark glass top, the chairs are stained rosewood. [Rosewood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosewood) is a richly hued timber wood. People often hesitate to mix wood tones, but my rule is that if they sit within a tonal family and have a similar finishing, they can work together in that room.

## Simple impactful styling

One of the common challenges that people have is to come up with a way to style their formal dining table while it is not setup for dinner. There are different ways that could be done in this space. I wanted this room to feel very calming and lively, so I rotate between variety of plants as a center piece on my dining table. Since the neighboring living room has lot of plants, this also harmonize the dining room.

In below picture, I have kept [Rosemary plant](https://wikifarmer.com/rosemary-plant-information/) with the tea set on the tabletop. To add more plants, I have placed Yucca and Bamboo on each sides of the window.

Below, I have placed [umbrella plant](https://www.gardenloversclub.com/houseplants/umbrella-plant/care-umbrella-plants/) with a silver centerpiece.

And finally, I tried placing [Anthurium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthurium) in below setup.

But if you like to make your dining space high and special, use objects like candle stands, vase, etc. and repeat it in various shapes and size. I would not recommend this setup if you have small kids at home. With little hands knocking off things, you can prefer plastic and fabric decors as an alternate option.

## Incorporate elements from other rooms

Our living room opens into the dining room, so I wanted to bring the elements of our living room to tie the semblance of both the rooms. By doing that, the guest will not feel that they are in different house when they are moving around.

My Buddha painting and the yellow rose painting are on the same wall. Although the tones of both the paintings are different, they speak to each other. The black color in panel and Buddha painting drags into the chandelier and wicker side table of the dining room. The pattern of panels complements the pattern of mirrors on the back wall.

I have a doorway which connects my dining room to the family room and kitchen. You can see the burgundy wall of the family room, so I have coordinated it with the red rose painting.

Now, all the elements unify the motif of all the rooms.

### Lighting roundup

Lighting plays a huge role in the ambience of any space and getting the lights right can go a long way towards making your room spectacular. We have traditional vintage oil rubbed bronze chandelier and it speaks well with the furniture and paintings. But someday, I want to replace it with pendent lights.

So here I am. I wanted to create something that is special and interesting but sophisticated and I think I achieved it. What do you think?
