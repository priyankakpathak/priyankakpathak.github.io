Have you ever noticed how ordinary things start to look beautiful when you are happy and beautiful things even more beautiful? A pretty room looks pleasing, no matter what, even on your bad days. It is one of the things about making your home lovely in your own way. It helps you feel better on any kind of day.

I want to share my favorite rainy spot of my living room. We do not have a balcony but has a great view of our patio right outside the window. So, I often decorate this little spot with various themes to work like a balcony. I like to sit here with a mug of hot tea listening to the delicate raindrop on the greens.

During my early designing days, my mother always suggested me to have little yellow color decorative in every room. Maybe she was right. I love the combination of yellow and black. I have purchased cozy, elegant yellow pillows that prove to be the best decorative accessories I have in my living room. Yellow adds little brightness to the living room even if the room does not get enough sunlight. They go along well with other black decors like black or dark colored carpet, black sofa, or a black coffee table. I added mixed metallic silver lighting for the warm feeling around the room. 

My house is a fusion of modern and tradition Indian style. You can take an Indian out of India, but you cannot take India out of an Indian. Along with other Indian accessories, I am obsessed with Buddha d√©cor and painting. I find it very calming and peaceful and so my stress disappears if I sit around it. I explore every possible opportunity to place them in my home and backward. I love the black vinyl decorative screen panels next to my Buddha painting. It adds its own charm to the room. The black and yellow colors blend well with creamy, tan walls and white window frames.

All the above things made a positive difference in my interior design. I think you do not have to add everything in the living room; the less decorative items you have, the more relaxed and open space you will get.
