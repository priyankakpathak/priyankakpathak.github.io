Welcome to my dining room. It is a big and bright room that can be seen from most of the other rooms on the main floor. Today, I will start with all the key elements that I brought into this room to make it feel upscale, where we love to have dinner with our family and friends.

## Walls

When I started designing this room, I toyed paintings for the walls and landed on the two rose paintings. I am glad I painted them because they fit perfectly in our dining room. This room is directly off the living room and can be seen from the front door as well as the family room and kitchen, it needed to have something that was interesting on the walls. If you have seen my [last blog about the living room](../2020-08-20-Living-Room), I had painting and panels going on the walls. I wanted to bring that simplicity into the dining room.

## Mixing wood tones

There are lot of different wood tones in this room and yet, it all seems to work well together. My dining table from India, has a dark glass top, the chairs are stained rosewood. [Rosewood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosewood) is richly hued timber wood. People often are hesitant in mixing wood tones, but my rule is that if they sit within a tonal family and have a similar finishing, they can work together in that room.

## Simple impactful styling

One of the common challenge that people have is to come up with a way to style their formal dining table while it is not setup for dinner. There are different ways that could be done in this space. I wanted this room to feel very calming, so I chose [Rosemary plant](https://wikifarmer.com/rosemary-plant-information/) with my tea set on the tabletop, Yucca and Bamboo on each sides of the window.

I also tried placing [umbrella plant](https://www.gardenloversclub.com/houseplants/umbrella-plant/care-umbrella-plants/) with a silver decor at the center of the table top that GAVE NICe LOOK.

Because my neighboring living room has lot of plants, I wanted to maintain the same harmony in the dining room. But if you like to make your dining space high and special use objects and a vase and repeat it over and over in various shapes and size down the center of the table. I would not recommend this setup if you have small kids at home. With little hands knocking off things, you can prefer plastic and fabric decors as an alternate option.

## In corporate elements from together room to tie it all together:

Although this room is located in the back of the house, it can be seen as soon as you walk through the front door as it open up into the living room, I needed to bring in elements from the other room to help tie it all together and not feel like you are in totally different house. Hence, I bring black and yellow runner which you can see from the distance and it pilled black tone from the living room sofa. 

My Buddha painting and the yellow rose painting are sheiry some wall the tones although slightly different but speak to each other. I have a doorway which connects my dining room to the family room and kitchen. You can see the burgundy wall of the family room, so I coordinated my red rose painting on the wall on the family room side. All the elements unifying each room.

### Lighting roundup

Lighting plays a huge role in the ambience of any space and getting the lights right can go a long way towards making your room spectacular. We have traditional vintage oil rubbed bronze chandeliers, it is speaking well with the furniture and paintings. But I really want to replace it with pendent lights. So there I have it. I wanted to create something that is very special and interesting but very sophisticated. I think did it pretty much.
