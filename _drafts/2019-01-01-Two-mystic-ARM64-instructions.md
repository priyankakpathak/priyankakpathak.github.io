This is the 4th of the blog posts series that talks about ARM64 performance investigation for .NET core. You can read previous blogs at:
*  [Part 1 - ARM64 performance of .Net Core](..\2020-06-30-Dotnet-Arm64-Performance).
*  [Part 2 - Memory barriers in ARM64](..\2020-07-02-ARM64-Memory-Barriers).
*  [Part 3 - Peephole optimizations in ARM64](..\2020-07-05-ARM64-peephole-optimizations).

In this post, I will describe an important optimization opportunity that I could find while doing the performance investigation that led us to get almost **12%** code size improvement.

### Crossgen

For those who are not familiar with [crossgen tool](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/crossgen.md), let me give a brief background. When you compile your .NET code (C#/F#/VB), a binary containing MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) in the form of `.exe` or `.dll` is produced. When you execute such binary, MSIL is converted to machine code by JIT compiler. The advantage of this approach is that you can port the produced binary to any OS platform or architecture i.e. you build a binary on your Windows machine and ship it to a consumer running Ubuntu. But there is a cost of JIT compiling the MSIL into machine code which becomes bottleneck for some apps that need faster startup time. Alternatively, you can precompile your binaries to generate machine code targetting a specific platform or architecture. Such binaries now contain machine code and when executed doesn't trigger JIT compiler immediately. Startup time for such binaries is now faster and some .NET developers prefer this approach. The code produced by `crossgen` have slight difference than the ones produced by JIT compiler (although JIT compiler produced code in both cases). For e.g. with  `crossgen`, in addition to having the code produced by JIT, it also includes code that make sure that during runtime, it can find the addresses of different types of method calls like delegate, direct method calls, virtual method calls, methods with generic parameters, etc.

### adrp and add instructions

As mentioned in my [previous blog post](..\2020-07-04-Dotnet-Arm64-Performance), the performance investigation strategy that I followed was to inspect lot of ARM64 code and compare it against x64. I did this analysis on the code that was produced by `crossgen` tool.
One thing that I noticed since beginning was that the code size generated for ARM64 was much bigger than that of x64. I will cover on what contributed to bigger ARM64 code size in a separate blog post. But I started investigating the benchmarks and framework library APIs whose code size is magnitude bigger on ARM64. The common pattern that was present multiple times in almost all the methods looked something like this:

{% highlight asm linenos %}
        9000000B          adrp    x11, [RELOC #0x20a0e212c50]
        9100016B          add     x11, x11, #0
        90000004          adrp    x4, [RELOC #0x20a0e212c50]
        91000084          add     x4, x4, #0
        F9400084          ldr     x4, [x4]
        D63F0080          blr     x4
{% endhighlight %}

It was not obvious what this code is doing. [ARM64 manual](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0802/b/A64-General-Instructions/ADRP) says that [ADRP] is a relative address from current instruction that is to be loaded in a destination register. On doing research, it turns out that .NET has its own calling covention to invoke methods during runtime. It introduces a layer called "stub" between caller and callee. Imagine "stub" as a table that containing entries to each callee. Caller jumps to the relevant entry of this "stub" table corresponding to the caller it wants to call. When binaries are compiled, the address of callee code is not known. But during runtime, when the caller invokes any method, .NET lazily evaluates the address of that method (callee code) and patch the "stub" entries with the correct address in process memory where the callee code is located. After patching, stub just forward the calls from caller to actual method code. If you are interested in knowning more, there is a great article about [stubs in .NET runtime](https://mattwarren.org/2019/09/26/Stubs-in-the-.NET-Runtime/) that you can read.

.NET's calling convention for ARM64 is that a fixed register `x11` should hold an address of "indirect cell" that contains stub code. Since the range specified in `adrp` can only address +/-4KB page, the upper 12-bits address is encoded in this instruction. The lower bits are specified in `add` instruction to redirect to an indirect cell that is farther than 4KB from current instruction. Thus the combination of `adrp+add` points to the final indirect cell address of the callsite. That explains why the `adrp+add` pattern was so common and was present in almost all methods.

### Redundant adrp and add instructions

In the above assembly code, you will notice that we try to load an indirect cell address `0x20a0e212c50` in `x11`. We again try to load same address in `x4`, get the indirection present at that address using `ldr x4, [x4]` (load the value present at address in `x4` and save that value inside `x4`) and make a jump to the stub code using `blr x4`. If we already have the address in `x11`, there is no need to re-populate that address inside `x4`. On the contrary, if we never use the indirection from `x11`, we should not bother storing the cell address in `x11`. But as mentioned above, .NET calling convention requires the indirect cell address to be present inside `x11`, we cannot omit that for sure. Hence, we should remove the redundant instructions that loads the address in `x4` and instead load the indirection from `x11` into `x4`. In short, we wanted our code to like this:

{% highlight asm linenos %}
        9000000B          adrp    x11, [RELOC #0x20a0e212c50]
        9100016B          add     x11, x11, #0
        F9400084          ldr     x4, [x11]
        D63F0080          blr     x4
{% endhighlight %}

ARM64 follows fixed encoding i.e. each instruction has fixed size of 4-bytes. If we can do the above described optimization, that would give us an improvement of 8-bytes per callsite. Before I started working on it, I wrote a small utility in [AnalyzeAsm](https://github.com/dotnet/jitutils/blob/a8343a8df3ffa88753cb20f0115154c69da11e23/src/AnalyzeAsm/Program.cs#L1503) to scan the ARM64 code produced for .NET framework libaries by `crossgen` and get an estimate of number of occurances of such redundant `adrp+add` occurances. I was surprised to see that there were around **615732** such groups in **126823** methods. That is approxiametely **4.9MB** of code size and was worth pursuing it.


### Result

With [part 1](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/35675) and [part 2](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/36817) of this work, we were able to improve the code size of .NET framework libraries by over **12%** which was very significant. 

### Addressing a bug

While the benefits were great, there was also painful stretch of couple of days debugging an odd bug that got introduced by my change. There was an AccessViolation (AV) happening in `ConditionalWeakTableTest` test around [this line](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/9ccfc40ec9db8bbc9806e8d4fce71b27eb442503/src/libraries/System.Runtime/tests/System/Runtime/CompilerServices/ConditionalWeakTableTests.cs#L486). Since this was the only one test failing out of 1000+ test that we run, it was hard to believe that it has anything to do with my performance optimization work. But the failure was consistent on subsequent reruns and was only on ARM64 which made it clear that it is something to do with my changes. The challenging part was to figure out why it was crashing. For that, I had to first find out where in the machine code (and corresponding to what part of C# code) we were accessing bad memory. This involved lot of stepping through the machine code. Once I found out that, I had to do `diff` of before and after generated JIT code to see what was difference.

From the difference, it was clear that there was a scenario (related to tail-calls) that shouldn't be optimized but it was still getting optimized. During JIT, before my change, we were populating the indirect cell address inside `xip0` register and then jumping to it, but my change was optimizing the population of cell address inside `xip0`. Hence we were jumping to an invalid memory location present inside `xip0`. The fix was simple enough.

Namaste!
